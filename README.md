## Automatic Pet Feeder with Arduino 

We want to build an automatic pet feeder with **Arduino**. In this file I will explain how to check if there is still enough water in the bowl of your pet. 

### Let's start

Before we start you need an Arduino board and the Arduino software.
- I used the Arduino 1.8.7 on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or newer
- For Windows check this website https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
